# SQLAlchemy Demo
This demo serves as an introduction to SQLAlchemy by providing 3 guided exercises.

## Getting Started
The exercises in this demo require python 2.7 or 3.3+. The easiest way to install python on your system is with Anaconda or Miniconda.
If using a previously installed version of python, the sqlite3 package must be installed as well as SQLAlchemy. sqlite3 comes packaged with most versions of python and SQLAlchemy can be installed using the following command:
```
pip install SQLAlchemy
```
